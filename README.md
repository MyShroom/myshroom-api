MyShroom
========

MyShroom is a mushroom identification system that uses Neural Networks.
Our model was based off of AlexNet, and was trained with
[caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/).

# TO-DO list

- [x] Write Scala API
- [x] Find mushroom pictures + name + info **NIMA**
  - [x] Create database from specific collections on ImageNet
  - [ ] Contact mycological societies for access to their info **NIMA**
- [x] Learn **Caffe** and its python interface **OMAR + JESSE**
- [x] Produce the official model once images and tags are collected
- ~~Write Django server to serve JSON on top of X labels and confidence values based given image~~
- [x] Report + Poster (in LaTeX) **OMAR**
